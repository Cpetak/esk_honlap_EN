## Attire

Preferably blue. But if you don't have a blue dress you'd like to wear, anything that isn't white or red will do :).

## Schedule

4:30 PM - Start

## Accomodation

Next to Csillagkert there is a hotel called [Petnehazy-clubhotel](https://petnehazy-clubhotel.hu/en). Being very close to Csillagkert it is convenient for those who want to stay only for one or two nights.

Alternatively, if you plan to stay a few days we suggest looking for accommodation in the city center and taking a taxi on the day of the wedding.
